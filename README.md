# DrawingMachine

This is a simple p5 project that simulates some sort of drawing machines.
You can choose between two shapes, circle or square, to draw on the screen.
These shape can move in three types of movement: circle, square, or X.

You can change the size of the shape, how much the shapes move, and how fast the shape rotates in a circle. Hovering over the sliders for size and movement size will show how big
it will show up on the sceeen.
